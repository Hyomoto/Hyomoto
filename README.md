Hello! My name is Devon, and I'm a longtime GMS hobbyist and enthusiast. I enjoy designing the systems and writing technical backends that people often hate to make! In my free time I also help aspiring GameMaker developers and maintain the Flexible Assistant Toolkit, a GML library of just such systems. You can find me on the <a href="https://discord.gg/eeDx4S">GameMaker Helper's Discord</a>, along with a bunch of other highly knowledgeable people. Stop by and say, hello!
